## âœ¨ Contributing to Magikube

This project is under active development, and the Magikube project welcomes all 
contributions from anyone willing to work in good faith with other contributors 
and the community. No contribution is too small and all contributions are valued.

In general, PRs are welcome. We follow the typical "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.
 1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub
 2. **Clone** the project to your own machine
 3. **Commit** changes to your own branch
 4. **Push** your work back up to your fork
 5. Submit a **Pull Request** so that we can review your changes

**NOTE:** Be sure to merge the latest changes from "upstream" before making a pull request!
